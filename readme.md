`load_tables.bat` is a Windows script for prepping and loading the cal-access tables into a local postgres database. the script assumes there is already a postgers database available. The script is written using just psql and gnu tools, so hopefully it is not too difficult to get something similar working on mac/linux. Note that the psql COPY call in `load_tables.bat` uses an absolute, not relative path. Otherwise, comments are in the R scripts in the /R directory. Just start with `1-acquire.R` and continue from there. 

The only thing the local postgres database does is help filter for recent transactions, since the entire file is too big to work with when loaded into memory. If you don't have postgres, you can re-write that section to use some other database, or just write a shell script to filter for the rows you want. If you can create the data.frame `cal`, then everything else should work.
