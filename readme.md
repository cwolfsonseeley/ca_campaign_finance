`load_tables.bat` is a Windows script for prepping and loading the cal-access tables into a local postgres database. the script assumes there is already a postgers database available. The script is written using just psql and gnu tools, so hopefully it is not too difficult to get something similar working on mac/linux. Note that the psql COPY call in `load_tables.bat` uses an absolute, not relative path. Otherwise, comments are in the R scripts in the /R directory. Just start with `1-acquire.R` and continue from there.
